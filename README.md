## <a name="why-nuxtify">‚ôæÔ∏è Why Nuxtify?</a>

Nuxtify is a collection of [Nuxt modules](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/modules) that will help you stay organized, maintain focus, and _ship weirdly fast_.

It's built on a loosely opinionated stack that eliminates decision fatigue and ensures consistency across projects. This extensible approach gives you incredible control over your site's structure and style.

Once you add a Nuxtify module (like this one) to a new or existing Nuxt project, you can use any of the components, composables, and other features instantly ‚Äì no imports necessary. And more importantly, you can override these defaults with your own version at any time.

**This unlocks a powerful way of working.**

Use the defaults when they're helpful, and progressively upgrade when they're not.

This means you can:

- Setup a new project using the default configuration in a matter of minutes.
- Use the default footer component, but completely change the navigation component.
- Change the colors of all the buttons with one line of code.
- Override the default button component with a style of your choosing.
- And much more...

In short, Nuxtify helps you build faster, iterate smarter, and maintain consistency ‚Äì without sacrificing control or creativity.

## <a name="quick-start">üöÄ Quick Start</a>

To use this module in your [new](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation) or existing Nuxt project:

### 1. Install the module

Install the module in your Nuxt application with one command:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add @nuxtify/pages
```

### 2. Update Nuxt config

Add the `@nuxtify/pages` module to `nuxt.config.ts` and configure it:

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@nuxtify/pages'
  ],
  nuxtify: {
    /* module specific options */
  }
});
```

Read the [üìñ documentation](https://nuxtify.dev/docs) for a complete guide on how to configure and use this module.

### 3. Start building!

## <a name="configuration">üîß Configuration</a>

### Module configuration

To see the full config, check out the [types](https://github.com/nuxtifydev/pages/blob/main/src/types.ts).

### Overriding the defaults

Nuxtify comes pre-configured with sensible defaults. Both for how the module functions and for the corresponding Nuxt [directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure).

If you need to override a [component](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components), [page](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages), or [layout](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts), create the a file of the same name in your project (in the appropriate directory).

If you need to override a [composable](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables) or [utils](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/utils) utility function, create a function of the same name in your project (in the appropriate directory).

> **Early Access Preview:**
> This module is under active development. While it is already used to power a [handful of sites](https://nuxtify.dev/showcase) in production, expect things to change frequently. I will do my best to call out breaking changes in the [changelog](https://github.com/nuxtify-dev/pages/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## <a name="why-nuxtify">♾️ Why Nuxtify?</a>

Nuxtify is a collection of [Nuxt modules](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/modules) that help you stay organized, maintain focus, and _ship weirdly fast_.

It's built on a loosely opinionated stack that eliminates decision fatigue and ensures consistency across projects. This extensible approach gives you incredible control over your site's structure and style.

Once you add a Nuxtify module (like this one) to a new or existing Nuxt project, you can use any of the components, composables, and other features instantly – no imports necessary. And more importantly, you can override these defaults with your own version at any time.

**This unlocks a powerful way of working.**

Use the defaults when they're helpful, and progressively upgrade when they're not.

This means you can:

- Setup a new project using the default configuration in a matter of minutes.
- Use the default footer component, but completely change the navigation component.
- Change the colors of all the buttons with one line of code.
- Override the default button component with a style of your choosing.
- And much more...

In short, Nuxtify helps you build faster, iterate smarter, and maintain consistency – without sacrificing control or creativity.

If you need to override a [composable](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables) or [utils](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/utils) utility function, create a function with the same name in your project (in the appropriate directory).
